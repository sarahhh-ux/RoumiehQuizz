## Project Description  
This project is a personality quiz-style website titled **"Which Roumieh Doctor Are You?"**. It humorously matches users with well-known professors at the Roumieh campus based on their answers to 20 multiple-choice questions. The site provides an interactive, multi-step quiz experience and dynamically displays a final result that reflects the user's personality alignment with a specific doctor.

The project is built entirely with front-end technologies covered during the course. It demonstrates proficiency in semantic HTML5, modular CSS3, JavaScript ES6 (classes only), responsive design, and external API integration.
